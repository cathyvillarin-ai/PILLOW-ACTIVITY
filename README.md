This project is part of Graphics and Visual Computing – Activity 1: Visual Art Challenge with Python Pillow. For our section’s theme (BSCS 3A: “Behind the Scenes” Meme), I created a humorous meme that captures the chaos, excitement, and struggles of intramurals preparation.

Using the Python Pillow library, I edited a photo and added text captions to reflect the reality of being a student during intramurals — from long practices to unexpected challenges. The meme aims to show the fun yet stressful side of the experience, reminding us that laughter is also part of school spirit.
